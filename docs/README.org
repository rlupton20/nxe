#+TITLE: NXE - a framework for provisioning nixos images over a network

* nxe-netboot

=nxe-netboot= consists of tools for building custom netboot images from a =configuration.nix= file.

** nix expressions
   - nixpkgs :: it's useful for us to have nixpkgs available in the nix store so we can reference the files needed to build the netboot image.
   - build-pxe-image :: takes a list of configuration modules from which it builds a netboot image.
   - nxe-build-image :: script which wraps =nix-build= and =build-pxe-image= to provide a command line tool, taking a =configuration.nix=, and producing files for pxe booting nixos.

*** TODO Merge build-pxe-image into nixpkgs
