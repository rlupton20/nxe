#+TITLE: NXE - a framework for provisioning nixos images over a network

* nxe-netboot

=nxe-netboot= is a script that helps build a custom netboot image that can be used for provisioning.

** nix expressions
   - nixpkgs :: it's useful for us to have nixpkgs available in the nix store so we can reference the files needed to build the netboot image.
   - nxe-build-image :: this is a script which knows how to build a netboot image. We install it as an executable in the nix store.
